# Practical Unix: Mastering the shell and command line tools

This is an introduction to the Unix command line and some of the most important Unix tools a developer needs to know.

In addition to the specific command line tools covered, we will also have a crash course on C and learn two different ways to program the Unix system:

- Scripting (Bash, Python)
- Using system APIs (C)

Fluency in Unix is an indispensible skill for a software engineer. Unix is everywhere: servers, development environments, virtual machines, containers... the reality is if you're not comfortable in a Unix environment you'll be at a serious disadvantage relative to other developers who are.

## Course purpose and goals

The purpose of this course is to teach the Unix system from a developer's perspective (i.e. it is *not* a systems administration course).

The course covers general usage of the Bash shell, plus several important command line tools including Git, tmux, Sed, and Awk. It also covers tools used in the developer's toolchain, including GCC and Make. You will learn how to program the system using Bash scripts that connect operations using CLI tools and commands and how to program the Unix system itself using C.

The main goal is to learn how to manage your software projects and day-to-day development tasks by gaining mastery over the Unix system.

## Operating systems and software

This course will focus on the latest LTS version of Ubuntu (20.04), but the skills you develop will be applicable to other Linux distros and non-Linux systems like FreeBSD.
